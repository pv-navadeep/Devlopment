# Learning FastAPI

**Date:** 17-05-2025

Started learning new programming concepts with **Python** and **FastAPI**.

- Explored the basics of FastAPI.
- Understood how API calling works.
- Tried out basic functionalities such as:
    - Creating endpoints
    - Handling requests and responses
    - Using path and query parameters

- Tried to learn about sqlalchemy 
- database connection error tried to fix
- have to work on more on databases 

**Have to upgrade FastAPI concepts**

**Today's Goal:** Implement a Books Management system (CRUD Operations)

- Developed a Book Management application.
- Implemented Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete functionalities.
- Used an in-memory database for initial testing.
- Learned about HTTP status codes and responses, and applied them in the project.

**Next Steps** (Completed):

- Set up a database using SQLAlchemy.
- Explored SQLAlchemy in  depth.
- Created and managed books using an SQLite database.

**Today's Goal:** Understand the Pydantic library in depth

- Explored Pydantic models for data validation and parsing.
- Learned how to define request and response schemas using Pydantic.
- Practiced using type hints and field constraints.
- Understood error handling and validation messages in FastAPI with Pydantic.
- Experimented with nested models and custom data types.

**Next Steps:**
- Explore advanced Pydantic features (validators, custom types).
- Integrate Pydantic models with SQLAlchemy models.
- Handle complex data structures in API requests and responses.

**Afternoon Session**

- Started learning **Next.js** alongside FastAPI.



- Explored how to build frontend interfaces with Next.js and connect them to FastAPI backends.
- Experimented with making API calls from Next.js to FastAPI endpoints.
- Learned about CORS and how to enable communication between frontend and backend during development.
- Began designing simple UI components in Next.js to display data fetched from FastAPI.
- Plan to integrate authentication and state management between the two frameworks.
- Next steps: Deepen understanding of full-stack development by building more complex features combining Next.js and FastAPI.
